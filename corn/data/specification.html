<DT>Intermittent observation

<DD>TDF only provided continuous time series sequences,
intermittent observations were implemented as scalar values
(in UED) 
    XXX provides for observation timing models.

Direct association with period
</DT>
<DD>

Previously there was no explicit association with periods,
there either needed to be a file for each period or
scalors or records were implicitly associated with a period by 
having date stamp that fell within a defined period.
It is possible that there are multiple overlapping periods.
