      Derived classes can override this method to add variable inspection
      to the list of inspectors.
      Instance description is a caption/label identifying the recorder.
      The caller (usually the owner) of the object will provide the
      the instance description because it will likely know the specific
      name or ID of the object to be inspect where as the inspecting
      object might not have much meta information about itself.
      The inspector may override this description and provide it's own.
      The inspector_instance description may be 0, in which case
      the inspector is expected to provide its own description;
      otherwise the inspector would be anonymous .
      The description should not be a type, but some identifier
      unique to the instance of the object.
      The object is given the context with which it is possible
      to identify the objects position in its instanciation,
      so it is generally not necessary to carry/compose such information
      in the description.
      The statistic indicates if the inspector is used as a container of
      a statistical element values  (I.e. an accumulator).
      For example, in the dairy model, a facility may have gas emission value
      produced for the day; in this case the gasses are daily value so the statistic is "value_statistic".
      The facility will have unreleased gasses which are cumulative so the statistic is "sum_statistic".
